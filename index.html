      Hey and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
    <p>My name is Kellen Njoroge
      I am a student at Jomo Kenyatta University
      pursuing a Bachelor of Business and Information Technology.
      I'm done with my third year currently deferred to take a course
      in Moringa School
    </p>
    <p> In my short time in Moringa, I have been able to learn
        the basics of HTML and CSS. With this knowledge I have been able
        to start on the following projects
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/KellenNjoroge/my-second-webpage"</a>
            my second webpage

              branching test project
    </p>
    <p>I decided to to join Moringa to be able to do my final year project
          in JKUAT well.
