    <p>Hey and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
    <p>My name is Kellen Njoroge
      I am a student at Jomo Kenyatta University
      pursuing a Bachelor of Business and Information Technology.
      I'm done with my third year currently deferred to take a course
      in Moringa School
      <p> In my short time in Moringa, I have been able to learn
        the basics of HTML and CSS. With this knowledge I have been able
        to start on the following projects
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/KellenNjoroge/my-second-webpage">
            my second webpage</a>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/KellenNjoroge/branching-test-project">
              branching test project</a>
        </p>
        <p> In my second webpage I briefly explore how to make a website and <br/>
           how to add pictures to a webpage.</p>
        <p> In branching test project I experiment with git cloning branching <br/>
           and forking</p>
        <p>I decided to to join Moringa to be able to do my final year project
          in JKUAT well.

          My hobbies include
          <ul>
            <li>singing
