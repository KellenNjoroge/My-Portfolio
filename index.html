    <p>Hey and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
    <p>My name is Kellen Njoroge <b/>
      I am a student at Jomo Kenyatta University
      pursuing a Bachelor of Business and Information Technology.
      I'm done with my third year currently deferred to take a course
      in Moringa School
      <p> In my short time in Moringa, I have been able to learn
        the basics of HTML and CSS. With this knowledge I have been able
        to start on the following projects
